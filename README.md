VibeVoyage is not just a tool but an experience. This app enables the user to choose to register and login to the app's notes page or find relaxation through the meditation page. Visitors do not have to login to benefit from the guided meditations on the Meditation Page. Registered users have an opportunity to store and track their health goals, notes, and tasks to improve overall physical and mental health. This app is built with the MERN stack, providing registered users the ability to create, edit and delete their notes and retrieve them later. Additionally, the user can be sure their information is protected with OAuth built in to register and login allowing seemless interaction throughout the site.
